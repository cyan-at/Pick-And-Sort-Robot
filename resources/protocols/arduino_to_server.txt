Arduino will forward the information from Odrive, and the
current state in the state machine. It can also forward the
PID outputs.

This will not happen continuously as the serial print takes
alot of time to execute. Therefor will it be done periodically
every 100ms.

--------------------------   
        STATE MACHINE    |
-------------------------
S_IDLE          =>     0 |
S_CALIBRATION   =>     1 |
S_READY         =>     2 |
S_RUNNING       =>     3 |
S_COMPLETED     =>     4 |
