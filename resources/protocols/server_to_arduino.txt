The server will send the object data from the python client periodically
to the arduino. The arduino will run its cycle and ask for another object location
after the last one is correctly placed.

TYPES WILL BE ENCODED AS INTEGERS RANGING FROM 1 - 4

------------------------
|        OBJECTS       |
------------------------
| square       =>    1 |
| circle       =>    2 |
| triangle     =>    3 |
| rectangle    =>    4 |
------------------------


{"type": 1, "num": 6, "x": 433, "y": 546}


Can maybe be done with multiple objects at once.

[
    {"type": 3, "num": 9, "x": 433, "y": 546},
    {"type": 1, "num": 8, "x": 433, "y": 546},
    {"type": 4, "num": 7, "x": 433, "y": 546},
    {"type": 1, "num": 6, "x": 433, "y": 546},
    {"type": 2, "num": 5, "x": 433, "y": 546},
    {"type": 1, "num": 4, "x": 433, "y": 546},
    {"type": 2, "num": 3, "x": 433, "y": 546},
    {"type": 4, "num": 2, "x": 433, "y": 546},
    {"type": 3, "num": 1, "x": 433, "y": 546},
    {"type": 2, "num": 0, "x": 433, "y": 546}
