# Pick-And-Sort-Robot

The aim for this project is to build a prototype of an autonomous industrial robot as proof ofconcept for future automated solutions in sorting systems. The robot will operate on a frame system,  where the objects are localized under,  and in between the frame. The main task willbe to detect,  classify and sort the objects as fast and accurate as possible.  Where as the core objectives for creating this robot is mentioned below:

- Design and develop a prototype robot suited to operate in various types of system, like forexample a conveyor belt system.  It needs to have high enough accuracy in both classifi-cation and movement. During development, concurrency and thread safe operations willbe taken into account.

- Program the robot so it can position it self within a three dimensional coordinate system.

- Develop  software  for  locating  and  sorting  of  objects  by  the  use  of computer  vision and Convolutional Neural Network.

- Develop a system that is fast and accurate, and will work in robust environments.

- Assemble the prototype and test it according to specified requirements.

- Design and implement a graphical user interface that can easily be operated by instructed personnel.
